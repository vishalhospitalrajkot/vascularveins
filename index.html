    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is now a single, continuously scrolling page. All content from 'Welcome & Anatomy', 'Vein Conditions', 'Diagnostic Methods', 'Treatment Journey', 'Recent Advances', and 'Proactive Vein Health' sections is rendered directly. Navigation links function as anchor links, smoothly scrolling the user to the respective content block. This structure eliminates the need for tabbed interfaces to hide/show main sections, providing an immediate overview of all available information and a linear reading path, while retaining interactive elements (e.g., condition tabs, timeline, charts) *within* each major content block. This is chosen to ensure all information is immediately discoverable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> Goal -> Viz/Presentation Method -> Interaction -> Justification -> Library/Method. 1. Basic Anatomy: Goal is to inform foundational knowledge. Method is a detailed text block. Interaction is scrolling. Justification is direct information conveyance. 2. Common Vein Conditions: Goal is to compare and detail pathologies. Method is a tabbed layout with extensive text descriptions, symptoms, and risk factors (tabs retained for *internal* section organization). Interaction is clicking tabs. Justification is to allow focused comparison and deep dive into each condition. A Chart.js bar chart compares common risk factors across conditions for quick insights. 3. Historical Understanding & Treatments: Goal is to show change over time and detail current therapies.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Veins form the low-pressure, high-capacitance part of the circulatory system that returns blood to the heart. They carry deoxygenated blood from the body’s tissues back to the heart (via the systemic veins) and carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart (via the pulmonary veins). Each vein has a wall of three layers – the tunica intima (endothelium), media (smooth muscle), and adventitia – similar to arteries but with much thinner, more compliant walls to accommodate larger volumes at low pressure.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Most veins, especially in the legs, contain bicuspid valves formed from folds of the endothelium. These one-way valves ensure antegrade (upward) flow and prevent backflow under gravity. Because veins are at low pressure, they rely on two main external forces to propel blood upward: skeletal muscle pumps (especially calf muscles, often called the “second heart”) and changes in intrathoracic pressure with breathing. Contraction of the calf muscle pump compresses deep veins and pushes blood towards the heart; as muscles relax, venous valves prevent reflux.
                </p>
                <p class="text-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Venous anatomy is typically divided into superficial veins, deep veins, and perforator veins. In the limbs, deep veins run alongside arteries within the muscles and handle the bulk of venous return (e.g., the femoral, popliteal, and tibial veins in the legs). In the legs, deep veins contain about 80–90% of the blood returning to the heart. Superficial veins lie just under the skin (e.g., the great and small saphenous veins in the legs) and connect to deep veins via muscular perforators. Superficial veins are visible under the skin and carry blood more slowly since they lack a surrounding muscle pump. Perforator (connecting) veins traverse the deep fascia to link the superficial and deep systems; they also contain valves that close during muscle contraction to prevent blood from flowing back to the superficial compartment.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Together, these three subsystems maintain efficient venous return: muscle contractions compress deep veins and force blood centrally, venous valves close to prevent backflow, and perforators ensure blood from the skin surface drains into the deep system. Venous valves (present in both superficial and deep veins) are critical. Each valve has two leaflets that meet to block backward flow. The coordinated action of valves and calf muscle pumps maintains a low-pressure gradient toward the heart. Dysfunction (degeneration) of valve leaflets leads to venous reflux and hypertension, the fundamental problem in many venous diseases. Because veins operate at low pressure, they have less smooth muscle and elastic tissue than arteries. This makes their walls thinner and more distensible. The largest veins (like the inferior vena cava) have relatively thick adventitia for support, but overall veins are more collapsible than arteries. In summary, veins are flexible conduits with one-way valves and rely on muscle pumps and respiration to return blood; understanding this anatomy (as first detailed in classic texts) is key to grasping venous pathophysiology.

            anatomy: `
                Veins form the low-pressure, high-capacitance part of the circulatory system that returns blood to the heart. They carry deoxygenated blood from the body’s tissues back to the heart (via the systemic veins) and carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart (via the pulmonary veins). Each vein has a wall of three layers – the tunica intima (endothelium), media (smooth muscle), and adventitia – similar to arteries but with much thinner, more compliant walls to accommodate larger volumes at low pressure. Most veins, especially in the legs, contain bicuspid valves formed from folds of the endothelium. These one-way valves ensure antegrade (upward) flow and prevent backflow under gravity. Because veins are at low pressure, they rely on two main external forces to propel blood upward: skeletal muscle pumps (especially calf muscles, often called the “second heart”) and changes in intrathoracic pressure with breathing. Contraction of the calf muscle pump compresses deep veins and pushes blood towards the heart; as muscles relax, venous valves prevent reflux. Venous anatomy is typically divided into superficial veins, deep veins, and perforator veins. In the limbs, deep veins run alongside arteries within the muscles and handle the bulk of venous return (e.g. the femoral, popliteal, and tibial veins in the legs). In the legs, deep veins contain about 80–90% of the blood returning to the heart. Superficial veins lie just under the skin (e.g. the great and small saphenous veins in the legs) and connect to deep veins via muscular perforators. Superficial veins are visible under the skin and carry blood more slowly since they lack a surrounding muscle pump. Perforator (connecting) veins traverse the deep fascia to link the superficial and deep systems; they also contain valves that close during muscle contraction to prevent blood from flowing back to the superficial compartment. Together, these three subsystems maintain efficient venous return: muscle contractions compress deep veins and force blood centrally, venous valves close to prevent backflow, and perforators ensure blood from the skin surface drains into the deep system. Venous valves (present in both superficial and deep veins) are critical. Each valve has two leaflets that meet to block backward flow. The coordinated action of valves and calf muscle pumps maintains a low-pressure gradient toward the heart. Dysfunction (degeneration) of valve leaflets leads to venous reflux and hypertension, the fundamental problem in many venous diseases. Because veins operate at low pressure, they have less smooth muscle and elastic tissue than arteries. This makes their walls thinner and more distensible. The largest veins (like the inferior vena cava) have relatively thick adventitia for support, but overall veins are more collapsible than arteries. In summary, veins are flexible conduits with one-way valves and rely on muscle pumps and respiration to return blood; understanding this anatomy (as first detailed in classic texts) is key to grasping venous pathophysiology.

                    definition: "Visibly enlarged, twisted, and often bulging veins that commonly appear in the legs. Caused by increased blood pressure in superficial veins due to weakened one-way valves.",
                    symptoms: "Twisted, bulging superficial veins; leg heaviness, aching, cramping, itching; edema often mild or absent. Skin may show lipodermatosclerosis in advanced cases.",
                    riskFactors: "Age, female sex (hormonal influences), pregnancy/multiparity, obesity, family history, prolonged standing or sedentary behavior. Prior DVT or phlebitis can also predispose (post-thrombotic).",
                    complications: "Painful ulcers, bleeding, persistent leg swelling (edema), skin and tissue problems, small risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).",
                    detailedDescription: "Varicose veins arise from progressive incompetence of venous valves in superficial veins. When valves fail, gravity causes blood to pool and veins dilate. The Global Burden study notes that valve “inadequacy results in reflux of blood” and that patients most commonly report leg pain, swelling, heaviness, and tingling. In the legs, the great saphenous vein is most often involved (running from ankle to groin). Risk factors include female sex, family history, pregnancy, obesity, and occupations requiring prolonged standing. If untreated, varicose veins may progress to chronic venous disease (edema, skin changes) and even thrombophlebitis."

                    symptoms: "Unilateral leg swelling, pain or tenderness (often calf), warmth and erythema; sometimes asymptomatic. Positive Homan sign is nonspecific. May lead to pulmonary embolism (acute SOB, chest pain) if clot dislodges.",
                    riskFactors: "Immobilization (recent surgery, hospitalization, casts, long travel), cancer and chemotherapy, pregnancy or hormonal therapy, thrombophilias (e.g. Factor V Leiden), obesity, heart failure, previous DVT.",
                    complications: "Pulmonary Embolism (PE), a life-threatening blockage in the lungs. Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS), causing chronic leg pain and swelling.",
                    detailedDescription: "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is clot formation in deep veins (typically lower leg or pelvic veins). The clot may completely or partially occlude flow. By Virchow’s triad, DVT arises when venous stasis, endothelial damage (e.g. surgery or trauma), or blood hypercoagulability come together. Common risk factors are immobilization (post-operative, casts, travel), active cancer or chemotherapy, pregnancy/hormones, inherited thrombophilias, obesity, and smoking. Patients may have unilateral leg swelling, warmth, tenderness, or may be asymptomatic; a D-dimer blood test can help screen for DVT in doubtful cases. If untreated, clots can propagate or embolize to the lungs."

                    detailedDescription: "Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) refers to advanced, long-term dysfunction of venous return. It can follow recurrent DVT (post-thrombotic syndrome) or represent primary valvular failure. Pathophysiologically, reflux in superficial, perforating, or even deep veins causes sustained venous hypertension. This raises capillary pressures, leading to fluid leak (edema) and chronic inflammation of the skin. Clinically, CVI presents with persistent leg swelling, a sense of leg fatigue or pain, and distinctive skin findings (stasis dermatitis, hyperpigmentation, thickening). Advanced CVI (CEAP class C4–C6) produces lipodermatosclerosis and venous ulcers. Major factors are previous DVT, leg trauma or phlebitis, obesity, and jobs or lifestyles with little leg movement. Importantly, even inactivity (sitting or standing without calf muscle pump action) raises venous pressure over time."

                    complications: "Persistent non-healing wounds, increased risk of infection, chronic pain, significant impact on quality of life.",
                    detailedDescription: "Venous (stasis) ulcers are the end-stage manifestation of chronic venous hypertension. They characteristically occur in the gaiter area (around the medial ankle) where venous pressure is highest. Chronic pooling leads to microvascular damage and tissue breakdown. Venous ulcers are typically shallow, irregularly shaped, and surrounded by discolored, hardened skin. Patients often complain of a dull ache or itching, and ulcer bases may ooze fluid. Key causes are long-standing CVI or DVT-induced changes. Risk factors mirror CVI’s: older age, obesity, prior venous clots, varicose veins, and immobility. Without treating the underlying venous hypertension (e.g. via compression), these ulcers heal very poorly."
